### Glad to see you here! &nbsp; ![visitors](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=m4xcrk)

As an Offensive Security Engineer and a Technology Enthusiast at large, I spend a lot of time debugging, learning, playing CTFs, and writing my blog posts while working as a professional and trying to get better experience in red teaming, pivoting techniques, AV evasion and analyzing modern malware techniques. I also put my hands on, hardware stuff, including Arduino & Raspberry Pi. I am always looking for a fresh challenge. 💡
